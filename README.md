# lineage_ota

This repository should be used for serving .json data to the LineageOS updater and *as a cloud for the builds*. If you do not want to have the builds hosted on GitHub, I'd recommend either a self-hosted h5ai instance or SourceForge.

The necesarry information to create a working .json file can be found in your $OUT directory in the file named *build_name.json*
